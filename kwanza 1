# Glacier Network

Glacier Network is a decentralized proximity-based social networking platform powered by blockchain integration. It combines real-time location tracking with a hybrid KYC-lite verification system, multi-token support, and a unique withdrawal mechanism. Built on Polygon for low-cost transactions, Glacier emphasizes privacy, security, and user profitability.

## Overview
Glacier Network enables secure, location-based social interactions through:
- **Proximity Networking**: Connect with users in your vicinity via real-time GPS.
- **KYC-Lite Verification**: Blend off-chain identity checks with on-chain credentials (Polygon ID/World Coin).
- **Withdrawal System**: Users withdraw $100+ balances instantly; businesses request monthly withdrawals after admin approval.
- **Gasless UX**: Meta-transactions abstract gas costs for seamless onboarding.

## Features
- **Dynamic Social Graph**: Discover nearby users/events via geospatial indexing.
- **Multi-Token Economy**: Support for ERC20 tokens (USDC, MATIC) and native $GLCR rewards.
- **Anti-Rug Mechanisms**: Time-locked business withdrawals + automated user cashouts.
- **Profit Sharing**: 85% of ad/txn revenue distributed to active users.

## Technologies
| Component       | Stack                                                                 |
|-----------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Frontend**    | React.js, Mapbox GL JS, Web3Modal                                     |
| **Backend**     | FastAPI (Python), PostgreSQL (Spatial), Redis (Real-time)            |

## Storage Architecture
Glacier implements a three-tiered storage system for optimized performance and cost:

| Tier  | Technology       | Use Case                              | Access Latency | Cost  |
|-------|------------------|---------------------------------------|----------------|-------|
| Hot   | Redis            | Real-time location updates, sessions | <10ms          | $$$   |
| Warm  | PostgreSQL (PostGIS) | User profiles, transaction history   | 50-100ms       | $$    |
| Cold  | IPFS/Arweave     | Archived media, historical data      | 2-5s           | $     |

### Data Migration Logic (Smart Contract)
To ensure data integrity during migration, Glacier Network uses Merkle Trees to validate data before archiving it in cold storage. 

```solidity
// Sample cold storage archiving (contracts/GlacierVault.sol)
function archiveUserData(address user) external {
    require(msg.sender == archiver, "Unauthorized");
    coldStorage[user] = warmStorage[user];
    delete warmStorage[user];
}
